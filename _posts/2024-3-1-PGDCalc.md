#### Developing machine learning models to predict primary graft dysfunction after lung transplantation <br>
Happy to share our latest work using AI/ML to predict primary graft dysfunction using donor and recipient factors known only at the time of donor offer acceptance. The tool is also publicly availabe at: pgdcalc.wustl.edu
